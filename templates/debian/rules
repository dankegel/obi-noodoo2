# 'debuild -b' would produce a valid debian package.

# PREFIX is where this project should be installed.
# By default, it's the same as G_SPEAK_HOME.
# To change it independently, do e.g.
#   ob-set-defaults --g-speak 3.28 --prefix /opt/a-better-place
# and if you want it to stick, set PREFIX in ci/ob-set-defaults.conf.
# (Sorry for the duplication.  ob-set-defaults may change to make that option sticky later.)

# Once ubuntu 12.04 is dead and buried, we should use the -l option to dh_shlibdeps;

# debian/rules is a makefile that invokes itself recursively, so prepending directly
# to LD_LIBRARY_PATH here would cause duplication... and on ubuntu 15.10, build failure.
# So let's prepend to LD_LIBRARY_PATH late in the shell using env, rather than early in make.
# Note 2:
# On misconfigured headless systems, libGL.so may be missing, which has caused us grief in the past.
# We used to pass the --ignore-missing-info option to dh_shlibdeps to work around that, but
# let's not do that unless we need to.

# Also, if SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is set (as it is on Ubuntu 16.04), use
# that timestamp for all installed files.  That makes it easier to
# compare built packages with diffoscope to find real differences;
